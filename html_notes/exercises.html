<!-- HTML Exercises
This is a collection of HTML snippets to practice. Read the content and recreate the HTML structure described.

Headings
You can write your thoughts here

Or rant about whatever grinds your gears

Like that Jeremy guy, for example

I mean, like what is his deal?

Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...

Nesting Tags
This exercise is about nesting div tags
This div contains this text and the div tag below.
Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs
Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.

Lists
This exercise is about making lists

Here's what I like about lists:

They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
That's about it
I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
When you make a list, do it in this order:

Decide if it's an ordered list or not
If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
You've got this, I believe in you!
Lines
Lines. So many lines.








I'm sorry...
Styling Text
Here's a couple ways you can express yourself

If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here
If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag
If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag
You did it! You should be proud of yourself

I want you to Google image search your full name and place the first result here:

Just link to any website on the internet and make the link text "Click me"

# Sample Document
Now it's time to create your first valid HTML document. Make sure to include the following:

Name the file sample.html
Add all of the proper HTML elements to create a valid document
Add headings, paragraphs and images to the body of the document
Go to the w3 Schools's HTML Element Reference page and pick one or two elements you haven't used yet and put it in the page
Group your sample content inside <div> elements into some clear structure
Open your HTML with your web browser and look at your results!

# Large
Since this is a basic lesson there is no large HTML exercise at this time. There will be more opportunities to grow your HTML skills in the upcoming lessons.
